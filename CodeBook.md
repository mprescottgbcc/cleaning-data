#Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Full disclosure: I'm still not 100% sure what each variable represents, so this code book illustrates my best interpretation of the data's true nature. Each variable used in the tidy data file is explained here with the best interpretation I can provide at this time.
